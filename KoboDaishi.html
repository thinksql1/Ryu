                Kūkai was a pivotal figure whose actions profoundly shaped the relationship between Buddhism and the state in early Heian Japan. He is the central figure in the introduction of Esoteric Buddhism, which profoundly impacted Japanese political, social, and cultural conditions. Kūkai is portrayed not as the founder of a narrow sect but as a figure who initiated a new discourse that challenged Confucian ideology and the <span class="key-term" data-definition="The ritsuryō was a historical law system based on the philosophies of Confucianism and Chinese Legalism in Japan.">ritsuryō</span> system. In 921, he was given the posthumous title <span class="key-term" data-definition="A posthumous title meaning 'Great Master of Spreading the Dharma,' granted by Abdicated Emperor Uda.">Kōbō Daishi</span>, an endorsement from the Abdicated Emperor Uda (Kongōgaku).
